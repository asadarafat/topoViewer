## Overview

`TopoViewer` is a network visualization tool that converts topology data into a Cytoscape graph model, allowing you to visualize your network using [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org).

The project is structured with a Go-based backend that processes and visualizes network topologies, converting data (currently supporting Container Lab) into a graph model for display. The frontend is a web application built with HTML and JavaScript libraries, including Cytoscape.js for graph visualization and Xterm.js for interactive shell access in the browser. When deployed on the same host as Container Lab, the application can directly access Container Lab nodes through the browser interface.

The codebase is organized into several folders prefixed with `go_`, each serving a specific purpose:

- **go_cloudshellwrapper**: Contains the main logic for running TopoViewer, including:
  - `cmd/main.go` as the entry point for TopoViewer,
  - `cmdClab.go` for handling CLAB-specific commands,
  - `cmdNsp.go` for NSP-specific commands,
  - and the `clabHandlers` directory, which provides handlers specific to Container Lab operations.

- **go_topoengine**: Manages the core logic for processing and visualizing network topologies, from parsing topology files to generating visual representations.

- **go_xtermjs**: Integrates Xterm.js to provide terminal emulation within the TopoViewer interface, enabling direct interaction with the terminal through the web interface.

- **go_tools**: Contains various utility functions and tools essential for TopoViewerâ€™s operations.


## Quick Start
For Quick Start steps, refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/asadarafat/topoViewer/blob/development/docs/quickstart/quickstart.md).

> **Note**: Exposing your shell via a browser can be risky. Use at your own risk.
