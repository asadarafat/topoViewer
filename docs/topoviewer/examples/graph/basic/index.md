# Graph basic

A minimal TopoViewer graph starts with named nodes and named links. Keep topology facts in `graph.nodes` and `graph.links`; let the stylesheet decide how those facts are presented.

## Expected Result

A minimal graph with two nodes and one named link.

## Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project.
2. In `graph.nodes.0` in topology.yaml, set `graph.nodes.0.labels.name` to `"Edge renamed"`.
3. Reload. The visible alias on R01 changes; its stable ID, relationships, and memberships remain unchanged.
4. Restore the original settings and reload to compare with the starting view.
