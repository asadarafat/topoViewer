# Light and dark theme variables

Theme-aware examples should use CSS variables so the same diagram follows MkDocs Material light and dark mode without duplicating the topology.

## Expected Result

Theme-aware styles should use TopoViewer CSS variables.

## Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project.
2. In `graph.nodes.0` in topology.yaml, set `graph.nodes.0.labels.name` to `"Edge renamed"`.
3. Reload. The visible alias on PE1 changes; its stable ID, relationships, and memberships remain unchanged.
4. Restore the original settings and reload to compare with the starting view.

=== "Live Viewport"

    ```topoviewer
    topology: topology.yaml
    stylesheet: stylesheet.yaml
    height: 420px
    controls: true
    controlsOpen: false
    title: Light and dark theme variables
    ```

=== "Topology YAML"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "docs/topoviewer/examples/styling/theme-light-dark/topology.yaml"
    ```

=== "Stylesheet YAML"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "docs/topoviewer/examples/styling/theme-light-dark/stylesheet.yaml"
    ```
