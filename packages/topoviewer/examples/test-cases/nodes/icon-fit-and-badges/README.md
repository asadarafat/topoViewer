Icon fit, badges, and status markers let a small node carry asset, count, and health cues. Use badges for compact values and status markers for color-coded state.

`iconFit` accepts `contain`, `cover`, and `fill`. This example uses the same wide SVG in a circular node for all three nodes: `contain` preserves the whole SVG with empty space, `cover` crops the wide SVG to fill the circular node body, and `fill` stretches the SVG across the circular node body. The demo SVG opts into stretching with `preserveAspectRatio="none"` so the `fill` behavior is visible.
